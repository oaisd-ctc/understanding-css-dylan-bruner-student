**Imagine two CSS rules targeting the same element, with one rule in an external stylesheet and another as inline CSS. Which one will take precedence and why? How does this reflect the importance of understanding CSS specificity?**

When there is conflicting rules in CSS it always picks the more specific rule. In this case it would pick the inline CSS because it's more specific than the external CSS.



**Discuss the scenarios where you might prefer using inline styles over embedded or external stylesheets. What are the trade-offs and benefits of each method?**

Inline styles are nice for one-off elements. Or when you just need to do something small without giving the element it's own class, id, etc.



**Why do you think version control systems like Git are crucial for collaborative projects? How might the workflow differ in a team environment without version control?**
They are crucical for a few reasons. One reason is that it's very easy to back to a previous version of your code if needed, for example; you push a update that breaks your code or has some undesired side effect somewhere else.

If you had to work in a team environment without version control it'd be incredibly difficult to merge code together when people finish what their working on. As a result of this many more bugs would pop up from missed differences in code. It would just be one big jumbled mess.


**GitHub Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment. What advantages does this offer to developers compared to traditional local development environments? Are there any potential drawbacks?**
There are two major benifits, one is that you dont need to worry about having the correct versions of dependancies when they're just automagically installed. Secondly you can edit code from any device, even your phone if you really wanted to. The main drawback is that it *could* be slower and that free use is limited, if you want more processsing power or longer use you have to pay.


**From the CSS properties you researched and implemented, which one did you find most intriguing and why? How can such properties enhance user experience and website aesthetics?**
The box-shadow property was fun. You can make some really cool effects with it. It can be used to break up a bunch of similarly colored elements on a page.
